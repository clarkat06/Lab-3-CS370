# Lab-3-CS370
Game Name: Hop To The Top

Intent: A platformer with the goal to move vertically.

Narrative Structure: Reach the top of the mountain while meeting new people and gaining abilities along the way. Reaching the top of the mountain is a difficult task that can only be accomplished by skilled climbers.

Mechanics: Move left and right with "A" and "D." Jump with space. Dash with LShift. Interact with NPCs using "E."

Aesthetics: Pixel art style for graphics. Meant to feel upbeat and cheerful through soundtrack and bright greens and blues.

Joys: It was fun using the tilemaps to map out the world. 

Struggles: Getting the game to restart but still retain information in the GameManager was difficult.
